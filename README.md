ABOUT THIS PROJECT


  It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.When it comes to identifying the cardholder, credit card fraud detection relies on authentication techniques such as MFA (multi-factor authentication), 3DS, biometrics, and OTP (one-time passwords). However, it is also possible to detect credit card fraud by looking at anomalies in the transaction
This is a Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection : Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine - [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The objective of the project is to perform data visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning often required to getting the understanding of the data and its insights. This project aims apply various [Python](https://www.python.org/) tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning opertation on it.

## Built with

basically , we have used 2 frameworks/platforms in this project.



Here,


1)python


2)visual studio code

 
 3)jupyter notebook

## Getting started
To get started,

1)clone the repository in your local machine

2)install the required packages

now you are ready to access the credit card fraud detection model.

## Prerequistes

Ensure you have python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries such as Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,tensorflow,skipy and sklearn, are set up according to the provided instuctions in the README before running the model.

install the requirements.txt file
                      `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

## Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.5.
Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

clone the repository to your local machine:
                  `https://github.com/Dhanushyam123/ADS_Phase1.git`
run the jupyter notebook file.

in your web browser navigate the file and open it.

follow the instructions in the jupyter notebook to train the model ,make predictions and evaluate its performance

you can also visualize the model.
                  

## Usage
Setup: Easily install the credit cardfraud detection system as per the provided instructions.
Training: Train the Anomaly detection model with historical data for analysis.
Predictions: Utilize the model to make accurate predictions.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using classification metrics.
Visualization: Visualize the fradulent data and the normal data.
Documentation: For detailed examples and guidance, consult our user-friendly documentation to enhance your investment strategies.
